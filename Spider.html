    Sony began developing a sequel to Into the Spider-Verse prior to its 2018 release,
    with the writing and directing team attached. It was set to focus on the relationship between Moore's Miles and Steinfeld's Gwen.
     The sequel was officially announced in November 2019 and animation work began in June 2020,
      with a different visual style for each of the six universes visited by the characters.
       With a runtime of 140 minutes, it is the longest animated film ever produced by an American studio.[6]
   Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles,
    California on May 30, 2023, and was released in the United States on June 2,
     having been delayed from an original April 2022 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Like its predecessor, the film received critical acclaim with praise towards the stylized animation,
       visual style, story, action sequences, voice acting, and script. It set several box office records,
        and was also a box office success,
         grossing $686.8 million against a production budget of $100 million at the worldwide box office,
          surpassing its predecessor and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of the year domestically in the United States,
           the highest-grossing film produced by Sony Pictures Animation, and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2023.
            The third installment in the trilogy, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, and a female-focused spin-off film,
             Spider-Woman, are both in development.
